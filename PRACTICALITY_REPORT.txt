SIMPLIFICATION PLANS
============================================================

🔧 FOOTNOTE SYSTEM

            SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:
            1. User pastes text
            2. User lists terms (one per line)
            3. System adds [1], [2], etc. after each term
            4. System generates simple footnote list at bottom
            5. Each footnote: term, one academic link (best match), optional vault link (manual)
            
            REMOVE:
            - Complex vault link detection
            - Multiple academic sources per footnote
            - Preview system
            - Footnote management UI
            
            KEEP:
            - Text processing
            - Simple footnote generation
            - Copy to clipboard
            

🔧 DEFINITIONS

            SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:
            1. Phrase + Definition + Aliases (what we had)
            2. Add classification/folder later if actually needed
            
            REMOVE:
            - Classification dropdown
            - Folder organization
            - Complex file structure
            
            KEEP:
            - Basic definition management
            - Aliases
            

🔧 RESEARCH LINKS

            SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:
            1. Three sources: Stanford, arXiv, Wikipedia
            2. Fixed priority order
            3. Simple checkbox: "Include Stanford", "Include arXiv", etc.
            
            REMOVE:
            - 9 extra sources
            - Drag-and-drop priority
            - Custom link management UI
            
            KEEP:
            - Link generation
            - Text processing
            

============================================================
RECOMMENDATION
============================================================

Build the simplified versions first.
Add complexity only if users actually need it.
90% of the value, 30% of the effort.
